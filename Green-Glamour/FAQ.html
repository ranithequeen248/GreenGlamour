</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>There are several ways you can dispose of your fast fashion garments in a more sustainable way, including:

Donate them to charity or thrift stores.

      <button class="dropdown-btn">What are the consequences of fast fashion on garment workers' labor rights and working conditions?
</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
       <p>The fast fashion industry is known for its exploitative labor practices, which often involve:
Low wages and long working hours.
Unsafe and unsanitary working conditions.
Limited or no access to labor rights, such as the right to unionize.
These conditions can lead to physical and mental health problems, as well as poverty and a cycle of debt for garment workers. By supporting brands that prioritize ethical labor practices and fair wages, consumers can help create a more just and equitable fashion industry.</p>

      <button class="dropdown-btn">Can I still enjoy fashion while being environmentally conscious?
</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        Yes, absolutely! Being environmentally conscious doesn't mean giving up fashion altogether. There are many ways to enjoy fashion in a more sustainable way, such as:

Investing in high-quality, timeless pieces that will last for years.
Choosing clothing made from sustainable and eco-friendly materials, such as organic cotton, hemp, or recycled fabrics.
Shopping secondhand or vintage clothing.
Supporting brands that prioritize sustainable and ethical practices.
By making conscious choices about the fashion we consume and support, we can enjoy fashion while also minimizing its impact on the environment and people.
